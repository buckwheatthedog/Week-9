Family Contextual Reminder (simplified)


Simplified Version 1:


Feature Set: 


For the simplified version 1 of the family contextual reminder, I will focus on the relay of messages from the physical device to a text recording device (computer keyboard, phone etc.). I will focus on being able to send messages to an LCD screen or Dot Matrix display. My goal is that I can send a string of messages (tasks and family responsibilities) to a screen that the user can acknowledge and interact with. The extent of the interaction will include one user sending a message, and another reading it and acknowledging it with a push button. Once the push button is engaged, the next message on the screen will display. It will continue like this until all messages in the list are exhausted.

Simplified Version 2:


For the simplified version 2 of the family contextual reminder, I will focus on the communication from one physical device in one room, to another physical device in another room. As a potential add on (if time permits) to Simplified Version 1, Simplified Version 2 will send a message to turn a light on another physical device in another room when a task is completed. The devices will continue to light up, back and forth until all messages in the list are exhausted.
